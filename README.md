## Workstation Bootstrap (OSX)
This is stolen and modified from [dstreby's Boostrap Workstation](https://github.com/dstreby/bootstrap-workstation)

## Notes

Currently only supports OSX.
When I have time, and need, I'll extend to Linux, maybe....

## Usage

- Run `xcode-select --install` Follow the GUI install to complete (hoping to automate this)
- Run `osx-bootstrap.sh` 
- Enter your Password
- Wait...
